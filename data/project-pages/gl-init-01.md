## Gimbalabs Initiatives
# Experiment #1: Video Content Library

### Project Leads
@mabloq and @farouk

We are creating a library of short video content. We understand that a lot of people learn from short online videos, and we wonder if we can use the medium to inspire people to dig deeper into big, new ideas.

The first video is posted here, and we'll be adding more in the coming weeks.
