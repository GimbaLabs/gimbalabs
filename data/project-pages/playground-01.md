Why this project
1. Event tickets serve as real world examples of NFT
2. Example of disintermediation - both opportunity and responsibility/support
3. By building what we can right now with metadata and native assets, we will
    - Create tools and microservices to support additional projects
    - Build a shared understanding of how smart contracts will help us to automate distribution of tickets (and more)
